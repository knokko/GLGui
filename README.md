# GLGui
The sub library of my project Gui that is required for using lwjgl 2

# Archived
This project will no longer be maintained because it uses LWJGL 2 instead of the newer LWJGL 3.
Also, the entire Gui project is now archived.

This project needs Gui, lwjgl.jar and lwjgl-util.jar to be in the build path.
